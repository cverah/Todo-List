# React + Vite

We all know how overwhelming everyday life can be, with tasks to do that seem to multiply out of control. But don't worry, we are here to offer you a solution that will change the way you handle your daily responsibilities.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-Likewise, this project has been carried out with props-driling type components, the libraries have been used to validate the PropTypes, with the UseState state variable and to record locally (LocaStorage) with UseEfect

- steps to initialize the project:
- after cloning the project do an npm install in the terminal
